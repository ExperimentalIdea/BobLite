## Bob Lite

This is the lite version of Bob.

### Features:

- Removing the rain/thunder
- Changing the time
- Removing the chat

### Supported versions:

- 1.16.x
- 1.17.x
- 1.18(.1)

## How to use:

- Double click the BobLite jar file. That will open the Project Selector
- Create a new project, select it and click `Open Project`
- After that, it should be pretty straight forward. The time is in ticks, like the `/time set` command

Once bob is done working on your replay, it'll open a file explorer. You can now copy the replay and paste it in the `.minecraft/replay_recordings/` folder

## Note:

Bob works on a copy of your replay, not one the original one.

Projects can be found in the following folder:
- Windows: `%userprofile%\.bob\projects\`
- *nix: `~/.bob/projects/`
